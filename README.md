# Mission to Mars

## Purpose
This week we learned about webscraping! We needed to pull images, create a table, and pull information about Mars and its hemispheres. Our scraped data was stored on our Mongo database and we created an html file that we formatted to present our data.

Here is the inital look at my Mars page:

I added a couple of stylized features to spruce it up a little bit as well as making it mobile responsive. The background of my jumbotron was changed to an image of Mars and I modified the font white. Also, my scraping button has been changed from blue background to orange. My Mars hemisphere thumbnails were also aligned all in one row:
